# Spring Boot Application with Spring Data Rest

The service is a basic example of how Spring Data Rest works and how it helps to minimize the boilerplate controller 
layer code.

It provides CRUD Rest APIs for all the created entities without creating CONTROLLERS and SERVICES.

It allows to change the base Rest API path.

It offers both Pagination and Sorting support and all the queries in the repo are automatically provided as Rest 
controller.
